# Summary
resume_summary: >
  CTO, engineering manager, software engineer & IT professional with 23+ years in the tech industry. 

  Currently at LOKE where I have been working as the CTO for many years now.
  
#  any my days are becoming less hands on than they used to be, though I still get involved when the need arises.
# Prior to that I have spent many years working in a few different roles covering software engineering, IT & project management, and network & system administration.
# Studied Computer Systems Engineering at UTS which covered areas of software engineering, electronics and telecommunications, and enabled a well-rounded understanding of systems and integrations.

# I have worked on desktop projects since the VB6 era, and web projects in early PHP and Classic ASP, before moving over to C# and .NET where I worked on projects using WinForms and WebForms initially before moving to ASP.NET MVC and WPF.
# Went through the jQuery revolution, then Knockout.js starting to build more and more front-end code in browser-based Javascript. Remember too well the pain of trying to get projects to work consistently across browsers (cough IE6).
# Started the SPA revolution (does anyone still use that acronym?) with Durandal.js (now aurelia.io), before moving to Angular.js (yes v1). 
# Started to use Node.js for production systems around the time of v0.6 and have used it heavily ever since. Loved the introduction of Typescript, even more so the evolution of it. Rarely start a Javascript project without it these days!
# Have since moved to React for web apps, after a brief stint with Vue, and starting to dabble more in Go for back-end services. 
# Got involved at LOKE working on Android projects using Java (pre Kotlin days), but these days all the mobile app work we do is using React Native.

# I have worked on projects as a member of a team, the leader of a team, as the sole developer, in a company, as a contractor and freelancer, with people overseas and in the same room.

# These days I do more code reviewing of code than writing it, and spend more time thinking about the right tech decisions for the company and its employees than myself.
# "Software engineer & IT professional with a diverse 17-year background in IT Management, Project Management, Software Engineering, Network and System Administration. Demonstrated ability to work effectively with individuals at all levels, and proven experience in leadership and management. An educational background covering software engineering, electronics and telecommunications enable a well-rounded understanding of systems and integration."
